## Python Projects

**Insurance Data Analysis & Prediction**: 
  [LINK to project: ](https://github.com/juliabeco/Python_projects/blob/main/Insurance_DA_and_ML.ipynb) 
  Description: Python project analyzing insurance data (age, gender, BMI, children, region, smoker, charges). Utilizes machine learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest) for charge prediction.
 

 **Phone book program**:
  [LINK to project:](https://github.com/juliabeco/Python_projects/blob/main/Phonebook.py) 
  Description: This Python project involves creating a program to manage a phone book, storing contacts' names and numbers in a text file. Functions include obtaining, inserting, and deleting phone numbers. 
  The program is menu-driven, offering options to perform these tasks efficiently.


 **Booking Classification project**:
  [LINK to project:](https://github.com/juliabeco/Python_projects/blob/main/Classification_project.ipynb) 
  Description:  This project involves analyzing and classifying booking information. The dataset includes variables such as 'Booking_ID', 'no_of_adults', 'room_type_reserved', 'lead_time', and 'booking_status', among others. 
  The project is divided into two parts: data analysis and visualization, followed by feature engineering and machine learning. Various techniques, including regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest regression, 
  were employed to classify and predict booking statuses.

 **Income Classification project**:
 [LINK to project:](https://github.com/juliabeco/Python_projects/blob/main/Income_Classification_project.ipynb)
  Description: This project focuses on classifying income levels based on various demographic and socioeconomic variables such as 'age', 'education', 'occupation', 'hours-per-week', and 'income'. The project is divided into two parts: 
  data analysis and visualization, and machine learning. In the machine learning phase, techniques like regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest regression were used to classify and predict income levels.
